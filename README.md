Student Hub is a student-centric app designed to streamline the learning experience. With Student Hub, students can effortlessly create and manage their personalized flashcards, facilitating efficient study sessions. The app not only simplifies the flashcard creation process but also provides a collaborative learning environment by offering video rooms where students can join virtual study sessions, ask questions, and share insights with their peers. 

## TECHNOLOGIES
Backend:

1. **Python Django**: Our project's backend is powered by Python and Django, a robust and versatile programming language and web framework that handles data processing, business logic, and the overall server-side functionality.
JavaScript: While most of the application's back end logic are handeled by python, we utilized a minimal amount of javascript for sending products to our backend for processing.
